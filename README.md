The Crooked Tankard is a _text-based role playing game_. It is powered by _web technologies_, specifically _built-in AI_ and _React_. The AI generates narration, items, and many more to create _infinite replayability_ and a _vast random world_.

## Building

To build the project, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

The project is an _NPM mono-repo_, and it contains two single page application projects: [`app-brainstorm`](./packages/app-brainstorm/package.json) and [`app-game`](./packages/app-game/package.json). **We only care about the `app-game` project, and `app-brainstorm` will be removed in the future.**

We use **NPM** to manage the dependencies of the project. Run the following commands to install the dependencies of the project.

```bash
npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can build the project by running the following command.

```bash
npm run build:game
```

To serve the game locally on port `3200`, you can run the following command.

```bash
npm run serve:game
```

After that, open [http://localhost:3200](http://localhost:3200) in your browser to play the game.
