End of starting rules.

Always respond with a JSON object, that looks like this:

{
  "populators": {
    "add": {
      "populators-file-key": [ ... populators to add ... ]
    },
    "change": {
      "populators-file-key": [ ... populators to change ... ]
    },
    "remove": {
      "populators-file-key": [ ... populators to remove ... ]
    }
  },
  "rules": {
    "add": {
      "rules-file-key": [ ... rules to add ... ]
    },
    "change": {
      "rules-file-key": [ ... rules to change ... ]
    },
    "remove": {
      "rules-file-key": [ ... rules to remove ... ]
    }
  }
}

For "populators-file-key", write the name of the populators JSON file you want to change. DO NOT ADD file names, that have no additional populators to add, change or remove. Feel free to add new files.

In the `populators to add` array, write the populator JSON objects, that are NEW AND NOT YET EXISTING. These will be added to the file.

In the `populators to change` array, write the populator JSON objects, that are EXISTING AND NEED TO BE CHANGED. These will be updated in the file.

In the `populators to remove` array, write the IDENTIFIER of the populator JSON objects, that are EXISTING AND NEED TO BE REMOVED. These will be removed from the file.

For "rules-file-key", write the name of the rules JSON file you want to change. DO NOT ADD file names, that have no additional rules to add, change or remove. Feel free to add new files.

In the `rules to add` array, write the rule JSON objects, that are NEW AND NOT YET EXISTING. These will be added to the file.

In the `rules to change` array, write the rule JSON objects, that are EXISTING AND NEED TO BE CHANGED. These will be updated in the file.

In the `rules to remove` array, write the IDENTIFIER of the rule JSON objects, that are EXISTING AND NEED TO BE REMOVED. These will be removed from the file.
